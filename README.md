# Formatting di HTML (Bold, Italic, Underline, dll)

Which one are you more interested in reading?

..formatted, or plain text?

Formatted text will be easier to read, because there are emphasis such as bold, italic and underline text.

When we are looking for important words or sentences... our eyes will find them more easily in formatted text than plain text.

Therefore, in making web... it's better to use a text format.

Well, in HTML there are special tags used for text formatting.

# Make Text Bold
Bold text is usually used to emphasize certain text, such as titles, subtitles, important letters, etc.

The tags used to make text bold in HTML are the <b> (bold) tag and the <strong> tag. You are free to use whichever, the result will be equally thick.
  
   Example:

 # Make Text Italic
Italic text is usually used to emphasize a new word or term. We can make italic text in HTML with the <i> (italic) tag and also the <em> (emphasis) tag.

  Example:

# Underline Text
Underlines are usually used to mark text that is inserted or text that has an important meaning compared to other normal text.

We can create underscores in HTML with the <u> (underlaine) tag or the <ins> (insert) tag.

  Example:

  In the example above, we used the <del> tag to strike through the text. Then followed by the added text (insert).
  
# Make Strikethrough Text
Strikethrough text means deleted text. Usually to inform the reader that the text is not being used or deleted.

The tag for crossing out text in HTML is the [s] (strikethrough) tag or the [del] (delete) tag.
  

  example:

 # Creating Ranks in HTML
Power is usually used in formulas. There are two types of exponents that can be created in HTML, namely the rank that is above (superscript) and the rank below (subscript).

Tags for rank in HTML are [sup] and [sub] tags.

[sup] to rank above
  
[sub] to rank below
  
  Example:

# Creating Markers for Text
Markers are usually used to highlight important text or important keywords. We can create markers in HTML with the [mark] tag.

Example:
  
![Screenshot (212)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115479895/210186894-a5195568-1b0b-439a-a8ca-38611ff9065f.png)

  The default marker color is yellow. We can change this color with CSS styles.

Example:

# Text Formatting for Computers
  
Apart from the text formatting above, there is also text formatting specifically for marking text that comes from a computer. Here are some tags used to format text from a computer:

[code] to mark part of the program code;
[samp] to mark the output of a computer program;
[kbd] to mark keyboard keys;
[var] to mark a variable;
[pre] for text preformatting.
Example:

# Merge Formats
  
  Can text formats be combined?

Suppose we want to make text bold and underlined, is that possible?

Of course, I can.

The method:

Yes, all you have to do is use the tags, for example, if you want to combine bold with underline... then we just need to use [b] and [u] tags.

Example:
